> Version control is a tool for humans first and computers second. The best patterns are those that help your team collaborate effectively.
{: .prompt-tip }

One of the most common questions developers face isn't about complex algorithms or debugging techniquesâ€”it's about workflow: "How often should I commit my code, and when should I create pull requests?" Whether you're new to version control or looking to refine your process, this guide will help you establish a healthy Git rhythm.

## For commits:
- Commit whenever you complete a logical unit of work that leaves the code in a working state
- Generally this means committing several times per day
- Each commit should represent one coherent change (e.g., "Add user authentication", "Fix navigation bug")
- Avoid going too long without committing as this makes it harder to track changes and increases risk of losing work

## For pull requests:
- Create a PR when you have a complete, reviewable feature or fix
- The PR should tell a clear story about what changed and why
- Typically this means every few days or when a user story/task is complete
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized (a few hundred lines of code is often a good target)
- Very large PRs (1000+ lines) become difficult to review effectively

### Some signs you should probably create a PR:
- You've completed a distinct piece of functionality
- Your changes have grown to more than a day's worth of work
- The changes are starting to touch multiple areas of the codebase
- You want early feedback on your approach

## What is the Goal?

There's no universal rule for commit and PR frequency. The goal is maintaining a rhythm that:

1. Keeps your changes trackable
2. Makes reviews manageable
3. Reduces merge conflicts
4. Preserves your work
5. Tells a clear story about what changed and why

Remember that these are guidelines rather than strict rules - the right frequency depends on your team's workflow, the type of changes, and your project's needs. What's most important is maintaining a good rhythm that works for your team while keeping changes reviewable and manageable.
