> Version control is a tool for humans first and computers second. The best patterns are those that help your team collaborate effectively.
{: .prompt-tip }

One of the most common questions developers face isn't about complex algorithms or debugging techniquesâ€”it's about workflow: "How often should I commit my code, and when should I create pull requests?" Whether you're new to version control or looking to refine your process, this guide will help you establish a healthy Git rhythm.


## What is the Goal?

There's no universal rule for commit and PR frequency. The goal is maintaining a rhythm that:

1. **Easier code reviews** - Small, focused commits make it easier for reviewers to understand the changes, spot issues, and provide meaningful feedback.
2. **Better debugging and troubleshooting** - When something breaks, bisecting or tracing through small, logical commits makes it much easier to identify exactly where a problem was introduced.
3. **Clearer project history** - Well-structured commits create a meaningful history that documents how and why the code evolved, serving as living documentation.
4. **Simplified rollbacks** - If a problem is discovered, you can roll back specific changes without affecting unrelated work.
5. **Easier merging** - Smaller, focused changes reduce merge conflicts and make them easier to resolve when they do occur.
6. **Improved continuous integration** - Focused commits make it easier to determine which specific change caused a test to fail.
7. **Better collaboration** - Clear commit messages and focused changes make it easier for team members to understand each other's work.
8. **Enhanced discoverability** - Good commit messages make it easier to search the project history to find when particular changes were made.
9. **Facilitated code ownership** - When commits are organized by logical units, it's easier to attribute specific components or features to their owners.
10. **Smoother releases** - Clean, well-structured commits make it easier to cherry-pick specific changes for hotfixes or feature releases.


## For commits
- Commit whenever you complete a logical unit of work that leaves the code in a working state
- Generally this means committing several times per day
- Each commit should represent one coherent change (e.g., "Add user authentication", "Fix navigation bug")
- Avoid going too long without committing as this makes it harder to track changes and increases risk of losing work

## For pull requests
- Create a PR when you have a complete, reviewable feature or fix
- The PR should tell a clear story about what changed and why
- Typically this means every few days or when a user story/task is complete
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized (a few hundred lines of code is often a good target)
- Very large PRs (1000+ lines) become difficult to review effectively

### Some signs you should probably create a PR:
- You've completed a distinct piece of functionality
- Your changes have grown to more than a day's worth of work
- The changes are starting to touch multiple areas of the codebase
- You want early feedback on your approach

Remember that these are guidelines rather than strict rules - the right frequency depends on your team's workflow, the type of changes, and your project's needs. What's most important is maintaining a good rhythm that works for your team while keeping changes reviewable and manageable.
