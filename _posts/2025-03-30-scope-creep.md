Scope creep is the gradual expansion of a project's scope beyond its original objectives, often without corresponding adjustments to timeline, budget, or resources. It typically happens when new features, requirements, or deliverables are added to a project after it has already begun.

## Common Causes of Scope Creep:
- Poorly defined initial requirements
- Lack of proper change control processes
- Stakeholders requesting "just one more small thing"
- Misunderstanding client needs
- Team members adding features they think would be useful
- Insufficient stakeholder involvement during planning

## How to Deal With Scope Creep:	

### Before the Project Starts	
1. **Define clear project boundaries** - Create detailed documentation of what is and isn't included in the project scope.
2. **Set specific requirements** - Make sure all deliverables are clearly defined and measurable.
3. **Get stakeholder buy-in** - Ensure all key stakeholders approve the initial scope document.

### During the Project
1. **Implement a change control process** - Any scope changes should go through a formal review process that addresses impact on timeline, budget, and resources.
2. **Document everything** - Keep records of all requested changes and approvals.
3. **Learn to say "no" or "not now"** - Be prepared to push back on changes that would derail the project.
4. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - If new items must be added, determine what existing items can be removed or postponed.

### When Scope Changes Are Necessary
1. **Evaluate the impact** - Assess how the change affects timeline, resources, and costs.
2. **Update project documentation** - Revise project plans, schedules, and budget estimates.
3. **Communicate with stakeholders** - Make sure everyone understands the implications of the changes.
4. **Revise agreements** - Update contracts or statements of work to reflect the new scope.

### Long-Term Strategies
1. **Break projects into smaller phases** - This allows for more control and flexibility.
2. **Implement agile methodologies** - These approaches are designed to accommodate evolving requirements.
3. **Conduct regular reviews** - Schedule periodic check-ins to ensure the project is staying on track.
4. **Build in buffer time** - Allow some flexibility in your schedule for inevitable changes.

Managing scope creep is a balancing act between being rigid (which can lead to an unsuitable final product) and being too accommodating (which can lead to never-ending projects). The key is to remain focused on delivering value while maintaining control over the project parameters.
